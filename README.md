# owasp-shared-suppressions

Repository with a list of vulnerabilities that were discovered during owasp-dependency-check vulnerability analysis and are considered false positives. Can also be used for shared vulnerabilities that are not necessarily false positives but are coming from Sympower libraries (i.e. they affect multiple repos). In the latter scenario, a Jira ticket should also be created (for the TECH team), to remove the suppression once the vulnerability has been looked into.
